/*! \defgroup inputDevices Input Devices
There are a number of different classes that together perform the input handling functions of CX. Start by looking at CX::CX_InputManager
and the instance of that class that is created for you: CX::Instances::Input.

For interfacing with serial ports, use ofSerial 
(http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/communication/ofSerial.html).

\sa CX::CX_InputManager for the primary interface to input devices.
\sa CX::CX_Keyboard for keyboard specific information.
\sa CX::CX_Mouse for mouse specific information.
\sa CX::CX_Joystick for joystick specific information.

namespace CX {

	class CX_InputManager;

	namespace Private {
		CX_InputManager inputManagerFactory(void);
	}

	/*! This class is responsible for managing three basic input devices: the keyboard, mouse, and, if available, joystick. 
	You access each of these devices with the corresponding class member: Keyboard, Mouse, and Joystick. 
	See \ref CX::CX_Keyboard, \ref CX::CX_Mouse, and \ref CX::CX_Joystick for more information about each
	specific device.

	By default, all three input devices are disabled. Call \ref setup() to enable specific devices.
	Alternately, you can call CX_Mouse::enable() or CX_Keyboard::enable(), if that makes more sense to you.

	Getting new input in CX requires checking, or polling, for new input with CX_InputManager::pollEvents().
	This is the only way to get new input events for the keyboard and mouse. When pollEvents() is called, CX
	checks to see if any keyboard or mouse input has been given since the last time pollEvents() was called.
	If there are new events, they are put into input device specific queues. 
	(If the timing of input is critical for you application, you should poll for input regularly, because 
	the quality of input timestamps is based on the regularity of polling.)
	
	There are two workflows to choose from to access stored events: The Message Queue workflow and the Copy-Iterate workflow.

	The Message Queue workflow uses the availableEvents() and getNextEvent() functions to access input events.
	You can find out how many input	events are available in, for example, the keyboard queue by calling 
	`CX_Keyboard::availableEvents()`. If there are any available events, you can the first one with 
	CX_Keyboard::getNextEvent(). CX_Keyboard::getNextEvent() returns a CX_Keyboard::Event struct that contains 
	information about the event. This all works the same way for the mouse. See the example below.

	\code{.cpp}
	// pollEvents() returns true if there are any events available on any input devices.
	if (Input.pollEvents()) { 

		// As long as the number of available events is not 0
		while (Input.Keyboard.availableEvents()) {

			// Pop the next event out of the message queue, deleting the original
			CX_Keyboard::Event keyEvent = Input.Keyboard.getNextEvent();

			// Process each event
			if (keyEvent.type == CX_Keyboard::Pressed && keyEvent.key == 'A') {
				//do something...
			}
		}
	}
	\endcode

	If you don't like the Message Queue workflow, you can use the Copy-Iterate workflow instead with the 
	functions copyEvents() and clearEvents(). copyEvents() copies all of the available events, giving you
	a vector of events to iterate over as you would like. Once you've copied out the events, don't forget
	to clear all of the events from the message queue with clearEvents(). See the example below.

	\code{.cpp}
	if (Input.pollEvents()) {
		// Copy events from the message queue
		vector<CX_Keyboard::Event> events = Input.Keyboard.copyEvents();

		// Clear events in the message queue
		Input.Keyboard.clearEvents(); 

		// Iterate over the copied events
		for (CX_Keyboard::Event event : events) {
			// Process events
			if (keyEvent.type == CX_Keyboard::Pressed && event.key == 'A') {
				//do something...
			}
		}
		// Look at individual events (not that you would normally need to do this)
		CX_Keyboard::Event firstEvent = events[3];
	}
	\endcode

	This class has a private constructor because you should never need more than one of them. If you really,
	really need more than one, you can use CX::Private::inputManagerFactory() to make one.
