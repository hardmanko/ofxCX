/*!
Sets the number of channels of the sound. Depending on the old number of channels (`O`) and the new number of channels (`N`),
the conversion is performed in different ways. The cases in this list are evaluated in order and only case is executed, so a
later case cannot be reached if an earlier case has already evaluated to true. When a case says anything about the average
of existing data, it means the average on a sample-by-sample basis, not the average of all the samples.

+ If `O == N`, nothing happens.
+ If `O == 0`, the number of channels is just set to N. However, `O == 0` usually means that there is no sound data 
available, so changing the number of channels is kind of meaningless.
+ If `N == 0`, the CX_SoundBuffer is cleared: all data is deleted. If you have no channels, you cannot have data in those channels.
+ If `O == 1`, each of the `N` new channels is set equal to the value of the single old channel.
+ If `N == 1`, and `average == true` the new channel is set equal to the average of the `O` old channels. If `average == false`, 
all but the first channel are removed.
+ If `N > O`, the first `O` channels are preserved unchanged. If `average == true`, the `N - O` new channels are set to the average of the `O` old channels.
If `average == false`, the `N - O` new channels are set to 0.
+ If `N < O`, and `average == false`, the data from the `O - N` to-be-removed channels is discarded.
If `average == true` the data from the `O - N` to-be-removed channels are averaged and added on to the `N` remaining channels.
The averaging is done in an unusual way, so that the average intensitity of the kept channels is equal to the average intensity of the removed channels.
An example to show why this is done:
Assume that you have 3 channels -- a, b, and c -- and are switching to 2 channels, removing c. 
The average of c is just c, so when c is added to a and b, you now have c in 2 channels,
whereas it was just in 1 channel originally: (a + c) + (b + c) = a + b + 2c. Thus, the final intensity of c is double what it should be.
What we want to do is scale c down by the number of channels it is being added to so that the total amount of c is equal
both before and after changing the number of channels, so you divide c by the number of channels it is being added to (2).
Now, (a + c/2) + (b + c/2) = a + b + c.
However, there is another problem, which is that abs(a + c/2) can be greater than 1 even if the absolute value of both is not greater than 1.
Now we need to scale each sample so that it is constrained to the proper range.
We do that by taking the ratio of the new and old channels and multiplying the samples by that ratio. `N/O = 2/3` in the example.
Now we have 2/3 * (a + c/2) = 2/3 * a + 1/3 * c, which is bounded between -1 and 1, as long as a and c are both bounded.
Also, 2/3 * [(a + c/2) + (b + c/2)] = 2a/3 + 2b/3 + 2c/3, so the ratios of the components of the original sound are constant in the final sound.

\param N The number of channels the CX_SoundBuffer will have after the conversion.
\param average If `true` and case `N < O` is reached, then the `O - N` old channels that are being removed will be averaged and this
average will be added back into the `N` remaining channels. If `false` (the default), the channels that are being removed will actually be removed.

\return `true` if the conversion was successful, `false` if the attempted conversion is unsupported.
