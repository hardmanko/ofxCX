		/*! This algorithm is designed to deal with the situation in which a number
		of random values must be generated that are each at least some distance from every other
		random value. This is a very generic implementation of this algorithm. It works by taking
		pointers to two functions that work on whatever type of data you are using. 

		The first function is a distance function: it returns the distance between two values of the type.
		You can define distance in whatever way you would like. Distance does not even need to be 
		unidimensional: note that the type of data used for distance is a template parameter. The 
		distance type must have operator<(distT,distT) defined.

		The second function generates random values of the type.


		\tparam <dataT> The type of data you are working with.
		\tparam <distT> The type of distance units used.

		\param count The number of values you want to be generated.
		\param minDistance The minimum distance between any two values. This will be compared to the result of distanceFunction.
		\param distanceFunction A function that computes the distance, in whatever units you want, between two values of type T.
		\param randomDeviate A function that generates random values of type T.
		\param maxSequentialFailures The maximum number of times in a row that a newly-generated value can be less than minDistance
		from at least one other value. If this number of failures is reached, the process will be restarted depending on the setting
		of maxRestarts. This is to help make sure that if the algorithm is having a hard time finding a value that works given the
		other values that have been selected, it doesn't just run forever, but tries over with new values.
		\param maxRestarts If non-negative, the number of times that the algorithm will restart before giving up. If negative,
		the algorithm will never give up. Note that this may result in an infinite loop if it is impossible to get enough samples.
		\return A vector of values. If the function terminated prematurely due to maxSequentialFailures being reached, the
		returned vector will have 0 elements.
