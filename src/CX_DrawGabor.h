/*! This class draws gabor patches using hardware acceleration to speed up the process.
Compared to the loose functions, like CX::Draw::gabor(), this class is preferable
from a speed perspective, but it is slightly harder to use and not as flexible.
You use it by calling the setup function to specify some basic information about the
gabor, setting a number of data members of the class to certain values, and calling
the draw function. For example:

\code{.cpp}
#include "CX.h"

void runExperiment(void) {
	Draw::Gabor gabor; //Make an instance of the Gabor class.

	//Do basic setup for the gabor by setting the wave and envelope functions.
	gabor.setup(Draw::Gabor::Wave::sine, Draw::Gabor::Envelope::gaussian);

	gabor.envelope.controlParameter = 50; //Set the control parameter for the envelope (in this case, standard deviation).

	gabor.wave.wavelength = 30; //Set the wavelength of the waves, in pixels.
	gabor.wave.angle = 30; //Set the angle of the waves.

	gabor.color1 = ofColor::green; //Choose the two colors to alternate between.
	gabor.color2 = ofColor::red;

	Disp.beginDrawingToBackBuffer();

	ofBackground(127);

	gabor.draw(Disp.getCenter());

	Disp.endDrawingToBackBuffer();
	Disp.swapBuffers();

	Input.Keyboard.waitForKeypress(-1);
}

Custom Waveforms Advanced users:

The Gabor class is meant to be somewhat extensible, so that you
can add your own wave and envelope functions. To do so, you will need
to write a function body that calculates wave amplitudes and envelope
amounts using the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). These functions will
be called for every pixel that is drawn and will be given various pieces
of data that will help them calculate the resulting value.

The waveform function has the following type signature:

	float waveformFunction(in float wp)

where `wp` is the current position, in the interval [0,1), for the
waveform that you are calculating the amplitide for. The return value
is the amplitude of the wave at `wp` and should be in the interval [0,1].
An example of a function body that you could use to generate sine waves is

	return (sin(wp * 6.283185307179586232) + 1) / 2; // 6.28... = 2 * pi;

where the returned value is scaled to be in the interval [0,1] instead of [-1,1].

The envelope function has the following type signature:

	float envelopeFunction(in float d, in float cp)

where `d` is the distance from the center of the gabor patch and `cp` is
the control parameter, which the user can set by modifying
Gabor::envelope::controlParameter. The function returns a value in
the interval [0,1] that is interpreted as the alpha for the color that is
set for the current pixel. For example, for a circular envelope, the alpha
is fully opaque for pixels within the radius and fully transparent for
pixels outside of the radius, so a function body might be:

	if (d <= cp) return 1;
	return 0;

Due to how GLSL works, these function bodies can be written as strings
in C++ source code and passed to the GLSL compiler as strings. In this
case, you just need to pass the function bodies to Gabor::setup().

See CX_DrawGabor.cpp for the function bodies in Gabor::Wave and Gabor::Envelope.
