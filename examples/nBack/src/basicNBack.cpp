/* Example implementation of an N-back task. In an N-Back task, participants must report whether
the current stimulus is the same as the stimulus that was presented N stimuli back. Assume that in
a 2-back task, the stimulus sequence is the letters (presented one at a time):

A B C A C B B A B

The second C and the last B would both be targets that are the same as the letter 2 letters back.
None of the other letters are targets. In an N-Back task, the number of stimuli can be very high
and the stimulus sequence may need to change based on participant responses, so they can be difficult
to design.

This example shows how to implement an N-Back task using an advanced feature of the CX_SlidePresenter.
There is a feature of the slide presenter that allows you to give it a pointer to a function that will be 
called every time the slide presenter has just presented the final slide that it currently has. In the
supplied function, you can add more slides to the slide presenter, which will allow it to continue 
presenting slides. If you don't add any more slides, slide presentation will stop with the currently 
presented slide. 

This is useful for an N-Back task because as a trial progresses, you might need to present more 
stimuli in a response-dependent way, so you can't just set up a CX_SlidePresenter with a large 
number of stimuli to present. In addition, you might not have enough video memory to pre-render 
all of the stimuli. When using a CX_SlidePresenter in the standard way, everything is pre-rendered
to framebuffers, which takes up a lot of memory even if what is rendered is very simple. For this
example, the number of trials is very small, so running out of video memory should not be possible,
but sometimes N-Back tasks have a large number of trials. In this experiment, we will set up the
CX_SlidePresenter to automatically deallocate memory for slides that have been presented, which
means that it should be possible to have arbitrarily long stimulus sets without having problems.

For this N-Back task, the presentation of stimuli will follow the pattern stimulus-blank-stimulus-blank 
etc. The idea is that you will load up the slide presenter with the first few stimuli and blanks. The 
slide presenter will be started and will present the first few stimuli. When it runs out of stimuli, 
the last slide user function will be called. In this function, we will check for any responses that 
have been made since the last time the function was called and draw the next stimulus-blank pair. 
See the definition of finalSlideFunction() and setupExperiment() in this file for the implementation 
of these ideas.

Once you understand this example, please also see the advancedNBack example. It demonstrates some other 
advanced options of the CX_SlidePresenter that should make it possible to improve the timing reliability
of an N-Back (or similar) task.
